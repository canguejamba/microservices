# Microservices

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged full-stack Microservice built with Spring boot using Event-Driven including CRUD operations, authentication, pagination, and more.

### Getting started 

Architecture for this project is based on the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/microservices) architecture.

## How it works

## Tech stack
The Microservices was built with:

* [Java](https://dev.java/) as programming language.
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) as web framework.
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as a software project management.
* [Jib Maven Plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin) for building Docker image.
* [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) as SQL framework to persistence layer.
* [Spring Cloud (OpenFeign, Service Discovery, Distributed Tracing)](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) as cloud framework.
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) as a message broker.
* [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a message broker.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to containerize each microservice.
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) as an orchestrator and container manager.
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as database.
* [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html), as embedded database.
